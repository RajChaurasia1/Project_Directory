								<ul>
									<li><b>Description: </b>Amylase enzyme was produced in the laboratory scale by culturing the bacterial strain(microorganism). Prepared media and provided adequate conditions for its growth, while following laboratory protocols. Substrates provided were wheat husk and rice husk, which are agricultural wastes. Both solid state and submerged state fermentation was used. After enzyme production, harvested it from the media, performed tests to confirm its presence. Calculates enzymatic activity of amylase produced for quantitative analysis. Then compared the production in solid and submerged state, also from wheat and rice husk. 								
									<li><b>Output: </b>Knowledge of laboratory procedures and handling of cultures and operating instruments like centrifuge, spectrophotometer,incubator can be gained from internet sources, research papers and most importantly from experience.Learnt how to produce industrially important enzymes from microorganisms. Able to handle living cultures.

									<li><b>Description: </b>What is MPA?
                             Mycophenolic Acid(MPA) is an immunosuppressant. (In simple words, if I have a kidney, liver or lung transplant, my immune system will identify the new organ as a foreign system and may attack it, to prevent this MPA suppresses this action till the organ gets adjusted and till my body believes that this organ is not "foreign" stuff),

                             What's an issue with this, & our aim?
                             MPA is a little expensive, our project aims to reduce its production cost.

                             What will we do?
                             In simple words, There are microorganisms which when you expose them in certain conditions, produce MPA. So, we set up different combinations of conditions to produce this to end up with the set of conditions that produce optimized results. To enhance this journey we
                             1. Understand the mechanism by which Microorganism produces so as know what changes we make to get optimized results.
                             2. Conduct a literature review to know about better conditions to adapt.
                             3. Use statistical methods to optimize this process of arriving at optimized results.

                             Besides, the computational and simulation aspect of this project is yet explored, which we aim to do, so as to create a library/tool to help people who work on similar lines.

									<li><b>Output:-</b> Ideally, to have MPA prices down in the market. (But will just end up publishing a paper, unless anyone has the will to convert research results to influence the market).
                                     End up making a 'go-to' computational, simulation tools or statistical methods to help other people working on a similar project but don't have a strong engineering background.

									<li><b>Description: </b>A dual axis Solar tracker was developed, with all the simulation, mathematical analysis and hardware implementation.Spider-bot is the project done under the Technical activity Centre (TAC) IIT BHU, but hardware model need to be modified to work it completely, it is still in TAC with almost, 75-80% work done.Simulation of the maximum point tracking for the PV panel output, its working in standalone condition as well as with the different loads.The leakage current minimization is a high-level project which require a deep knowledge in Power Electronics field, and also closed-loop control simulation knowledge and feedback circuitry as well. This project cannot be done alone, it require the guidance of the professor. My project was under RK Singh Sir.
															
									<li><b>Output:-</b>Each project has its own output. Majorly the solar tracker project is implemented with the real time and an increase in power output of 10-15% is obtained since our panel was of very less watt. Other projects need to be first understood with the related papers specially for the PV, and MPPT there are various sources available like Youtube specially go for some research papers for the better understanding. Then the project can be performed, and the output was to obtain a better power output, some boost methods and buck methods as required by the load.

                                    Due to the high current at the time of fault occurrence, the whole system might be de-energized which would have a severely negative impact on the entire system.his project aims to work on a highly effective new method to protect the microgrid system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will detect and find the location of the fault before it affects other parts of the system. 

																	
									<li><b>Output:-</b>An effective method to detect, isolate, and protect the power microgrid system against the effects of short circuit faults is extremely important. 
                                    It would, therefore, be more dependable for microgrid protection. This protection network is distributed all along the power microgrid system protecting the entire microgrid network and is connected to the other protective devices in the system.

									<li><b>Description: </b>Under the guidance of a mentor, prepared a case study to improve the productivity of HEMMs.
                                    Analyzed the different blast parameters like Explosives, Charging pattern , Burden and Spacing ratios.
																		
									<li><b>Output: </b>  Concluded results to optimize the output of blasting operation by controlling various phenomenon like
                                    size of fragmentation, Fly rock and ground vibrations .
